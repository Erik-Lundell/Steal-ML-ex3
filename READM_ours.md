## ToDos

3 Datasets:
- 1 to validate the Model from the Paper

2 diffrent Models to bee stolen, preferably:
- One locally
- One Querying
(though if it hard to implement one of the 2 I would just do 2 of the same)

1 Model that is stealing
- Preferably one of the Type 1 Models since they seem computationaly much less heavy and therefore easier to implement

My understanding is that we never really have to do a Model of our own, but just use the allready implemented MOdels from the paper and play around with that.
